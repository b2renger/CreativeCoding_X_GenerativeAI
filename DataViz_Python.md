# Try generative models to code with Python
In the folder "DataViz_With_Python" you will find a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of using Python to code a generative model.

## Usage
To use the notebook, you will need to install the following elements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter notebook
Then you just need to follow the cells one by one.

You will need a kaggle account to access the data.

## Data
In this use case we use 2 datasets coming from kaggle:
- "Generative AI tweets"
- "World data 2023"
