## LLama Coder on Faraday.dev

ðŸ¤– : *Hello User. How can I help you today ?*

ðŸ¤“ : **Hello ! I would like to try to learn how to code simple generative visual with p5js, can you help me ?**

ðŸ¤– : *Of course ! There are many resources available online for learning about p5js. Have you tried looking at the official website or tutorials on YouTube?*

ðŸ¤“ : **Yes I have an empty example opened up in visual studio code and I'm about to edit the sketch.js file**

ðŸ¤– : *Great! You can start by creating a new canvas element in your HTML file. Then, you'll need to create a function called setup() that will be run once when the program starts. Inside this function, you can set the size of the canvas using the width and height properties. For example:*
```js
canvas = createCanvas(400, 400);
```

ðŸ¤“ : **ok how do I make the canvas fullscreen and responsive ?**

ðŸ¤– : *To make the canvas fullscreen, you can use the fullScreen() function. This will adjust the canvas to fit the screen size. To make it responsive, you can use the windowWidth and windowHeight variables in your setup() function to set the canvas size based on the current window size. For example:*

```js
canvas = createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
``` 
ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

A small mistake : let's say it's shared :) https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fullscreen

The fullScreen is not the term I should have used to make the canvas full width and responsive. Let's try to clarify that 

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬


ðŸ¤“ : **After checking the documentation the fullScreen function doesn't seem to do what I actually want. I just want my canvas to take the full size of the browser window, even when the user resizes it**

ðŸ¤– : *That's a good point! In that case, you can use the CSS property "width" and "height" to set the canvas size to 100% of the parent element. You can also use the "position" property to make sure the canvas is positioned in the top left corner of its parent element. For example:*

```css
canvas {

    width: 100%;

    height: 100%;

    position: absolute;

}
```

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

Well that is right but kind of missing the point ... I should probably ask what is a parent element, ask about html etc. But I could also try giving it a nudge in the right direction as I know the tool:

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬


ðŸ¤“ : **It does not work as I would like, but I search online and found the windowResized() function can you explain it to me ?**

ðŸ¤– : *The windowResized() function is called automatically when the browser window is resized. This allows you to adjust your code to fit the new screen size. You can use this function to update the canvas size based on the current window size. For example:*

```js
function windowResized() {
    resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
```

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

Not bad but the documentation page looks way better : https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/windowResized

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬


ðŸ¤“ : **Now I would like to create a grid of circles and I would like to be able to specify the number of lines and columns I want in this grid aswell as margins. Circles should be centered in each cell and of random sizes.**

ðŸ¤– : *Sure thing! To create a grid of circles, you can use nested for loops. The outer loop will iterate over rows, while the inner loop will iterate over columns. You can use the modulo operator (%) to determine which row and column you're on, and then use that information to calculate the center coordinates of each circle. For example:*

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {

    background(255);

    // Get the number of rows and columns from the user
    let numRows = prompt("How many rows?");
    let numCols = prompt("How many columns?");

    // Calculate the margin between circles
    let margin = width / (numCols + 1);

    // Iterate over rows
    for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
        // Iterate over columns
        for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
            // Calculate the center coordinates of each circle
            let x = margin * (col + 1) - margin / 2;
            let y = margin * (row + 1) - margin / 2;
            // Draw a random-sized circle at that position
            fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
            ellipse(x, y, random(width / 20, width / 10), random(height / 20, height / 10));
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤“ : **This is nice but the grid doesn't span the full width or height of the browser window, everything is cramed in the upper left corner**

ðŸ¤– : *That's because we haven't adjusted for the margins yet. We can do that by adding a margin to each circle's center coordinates based on its position in the grid. For example:*

```js
function draw() {

    background(255);
    // Get the number of rows and columns from the user
    let numRows = prompt("How many rows?");
    let numCols = prompt("How many columns?");

    // Calculate the margin between circles
    let margin = width / (numCols + 1);

    // Iterate over rows
    for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
        // Iterate over columns
        for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
            // Calculate the center coordinates of each circle
            let x = margin * (col + 1) - margin / 2;
            let y = margin * (row + 1) - margin / 2;
            // Add a margin to the center coordinates based on their position in the grid
            x += margin * col;
            y += margin * row;
            // Draw a random-sized circle at that position
            fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
            ellipse(x, y, random(width / 20, width / 10), random(height / 20, height / 10));
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤“ : **I've looked up online : people talk about using the map function like here : https://github.com/b2renger/p5js-designing-interactive-patterns#une-page-web-responsive---dessiner-un-cercle-qui-reste-au-milieu**

ðŸ¤– : *Yes, that's a good approach too! The map() function can be used to convert values from one range to another. In this case, we can use it to convert our grid coordinates (0 to numCols - 1) to screen coordinates (0 to width). For example:*

```js
function draw() {
    background(255);
    // Get the number of rows and columns from the user
    let numRows = prompt("How many rows?");
    let numCols = prompt("How many columns?");
    // Calculate the margin between circles
    let margin = width / (numCols + 1);
    // Iterate over rows
    for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
        // Iterate over columns
        for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
            // Convert our grid coordinates to screen coordinates using map()
            let x = map(col, 0, numCols - 1, 0, width);
            let y = map(row, 0, numRows - 1, 0, height);
            // Add a margin to the center coordinates based on their position in the grid
            x += margin * col;
            y += margin * row;
            // Draw a random-sized circle at that position
            fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
            ellipse(x, y, random(width / 20, width / 10), random(height / 20, height / 10));
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤“ : **Hello ! I have this code :**

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬
--- Insert code above in here to give context to LLama ---
ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

**I would like to remove the promting of the user, I would like to be able to set those numbers in the code instead.**


ðŸ¤– : *Sure! You can just replace the prompts with your desired values. For example:*

```js
let numRows = 5; // Change this value as needed
let numCols = 7; // Change this value as needed
function setup() {
Â  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
function draw() {
Â  background(0, 100, 200);
Â  // Iterate over rows
Â  for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
Â  Â  Â  // Iterate over columns
Â  Â  Â  for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  // Convert our grid coordinates to screen coordinates using map()
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  let x = map(col, 0, numCols - 1, 0, width);
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  let y = map(row, 0, numRows - 1, 0, height);
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  // Draw a random-sized circle at that position
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  ellipse(x, y, random(width / 20, width / 10), random(height / 20, height / 10));
Â  Â  Â  }
Â  }
}
function windowResized() {
Â  resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
```

ðŸ¤“ : **Great ! but the visuals keep changing size and colors, how can I fix this ?**

ðŸ¤– : *You're seeing that because you have a for loop inside of your draw function. This means that every time the browser redraws the canvas, it will run through your entire code again. To stop this from happening, you should move your for loops outside of the draw function and into setup().*

```js
let numRows = 5; // Change this value as needed
let numCols = 7; // Change this value as needed

function setup() {
Â  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
Â  // Iterate over rows
Â  for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
Â  Â  Â  // Iterate over columns
Â  Â  Â  for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  // Convert our grid coordinates to screen coordinates using map()
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  let x = map(col, 0, numCols - 1, 0, width);
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  let y = map(row, 0, numRows - 1, 0, height);
Â  Â  Â  }
Â  }
}

function draw() {
Â  background(0, 100, 200);
Â  // Iterate over rows
Â  for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
Â  Â  Â  // Iterate over columns
Â  Â  Â  for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  // Draw a random-sized circle at that position
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  ellipse(x, y, random(width / 20, width / 10), random(height / 20, height / 10));
Â  Â  Â  }
Â  }
}

function windowResized() {
Â  resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
```

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

This is an acceptable answer, but I would prevent me to animate anything afterwards so let's ask about this...

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

ðŸ¤“ : **Thank you but if I do that I might have trouble animating things afterwards if I understand correctly. How can we still fix this but keep the code in the draw loop ?**


ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

Giving me the previous code ...
Asking again ... it tells me to remove the code from the draw loop
etc.

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

ðŸ¤“ : **How about using randomSeed ?**

ðŸ¤– : *That would work too! The randomSeed() function allows you to set an initial value for the random() function so that you can get consistent results each time you call it. If you want to use randomSeed(), then you should put it at the beginning of your program before any calls to random()*

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

trying to be more subtle ...
 
ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

ðŸ¤“ : **Isn't there a way to make the random numbers always the same until I press a key for instance, to change the arrangement ?**

ðŸ¤– : *Yes! You can use the randomSeed() function to set a seed value for your random number generator. Then, as long as you don't call randomSeed() again, all of your calls to random() will return the same values.*

```js
function setup() {

Â  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

Â  // Set a seed value so that our random numbers are consistent every time we run the sketch

Â  randomSeed(1234567890);

}

let numRows = 5; // Change this value as needed

let numCols = 7; // Change this value as needed

function draw() {

Â  background(0, 100, 200);

Â  // Iterate over rows

Â  for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {

Â  Â  // Iterate over columns

Â  Â  for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {

Â  Â  Â  let x = map(col, 0, numCols - 1, width / 8, width * 7 / 8)

Â  Â  Â  let y = map(row, 0, numRows - 1, height / 8, height * 7 / 8)

Â  Â  Â  fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));

Â  Â  Â  ellipse(x, y, random(width / 20, width / 10), random(height / 20, height / 10));

Â  Â  }

Â  }

}

function windowResized() {

Â  resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

}
```


## Continuing with phind

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

How other models would work on this issue ? Calling phind ! (before the randomSeed part)

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬


ðŸ¤“ : **Hello I have the code below, but when I run it the circle keep on flickering in sizes and colors, how can I fix this ?**

ðŸ¤– : *From the code you've provided, it seems like the issue is that the variables `x` and `y` are not defined in the `draw()` function. They are defined in the `setup()` function, but they are not accessible in the `draw()` function because they are local to the `setup()` function.* 
*Also, the `fill()` and `ellipse()` functions are called with `random()` values each time the `draw()` function is called, which is why the circle is flickering in sizes and colors.* 
*To fix this, you need to define `x` and `y` in the `draw()` function, and if you want the circle to have a constant color and size, you should set the color and size outside the `draw()` function.*
*Let me know if you need help with how to implement these changes.*


ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

Basically it tells me to move everything outside the draw() again ...

ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬

ðŸ¤“ : **Yes but if do this I will loose the possibility to animate anything afterwards, is there another way to do this ?**

ðŸ¤– : *Yes, there is another way to do this. You can create an array of objects, where each object represents a circle with its own properties such as x, y, color, and size. This way, you can animate each circle individually.*

*Here's a rough idea of how you can do this:*

```js
let circles = [];

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  // Iterate over rows
  for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
    // Iterate over columns
    for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
      // Convert our grid coordinates to screen coordinates using map()
      let x = map(col, 0, numCols - 1, 0, width);
      let y = map(row, 0, numRows - 1, 0, height);
      // Create a circle object with its own properties
      let circle = {
        x: x,
        y: y,
        color: [random(255), random(255), random(255)],
        size: random(width / 20, width / 10)
      };
      // Add the circle object to the array
      circles.push(circle);
    }
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(0, 100, 200);
  // Iterate over the circles array
  for (let i = 0; i < circles.length; i++) {
    // Get the current circle
    let circle = circles[i];
    // Set the fill color to the circle's color
    fill(circle.color);
    // Draw the circle at its position with its size
    ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.size, circle.size);
  }
}

function windowResized() {
  resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
```

*This way, each circle has its own color and size that is set once in the setup() function, and then used in the draw() function. If you want to animate the circles, you can change the properties of the circle objects in the draw() function.*

ðŸ¤“ : **Great thanks, but isn't there a way to  make the random numbers always the same until I press a key for instance, to change the arrangement ?**


ðŸ¤– : *Yes, you can achieve this by using a seed for the random number generator. The randomSeed() function in p5.js allows you to seed the random number generator to get a predictable sequence of pseudo-random numbers.*

*You can set a random seed in the setup() function, and then change the seed when a key is pressed. Here's how you can do this:*

```js
let circles = [];
let seed;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  seed = random(1000); // Set an initial seed
  createCircles();
}

function draw() {
  background(0, 100, 200);
  // Iterate over the circles array
  for (let i = 0; i < circles.length; i++) {
    // Get the current circle
    let circle = circles[i];
    // Set the fill color to the circle's color
    fill(circle.color);
    // Draw the circle at its position with its size
    ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.size, circle.size);
  }
}

function keyPressed() {
  seed = random(1000); // Change the seed when a key is pressed
  createCircles(); // Recreate the circles with the new seed
}

function createCircles() {
  randomSeed(seed); // Seed the random number generator
  circles = []; // Clear the circles array
  // Iterate over rows
  for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
    // Iterate over columns
    for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
      // Convert our grid coordinates to screen coordinates using map()
      let x = map(col, 0, numCols - 1, 0, width);
      let y = map(row, 0, numRows - 1, 0, height);
      // Create a circle object with its own properties
      let circle = {
        x: x,
        y: y,
        color: [random(255), random(255), random(255)],
        size: random(width / 20, width / 10)
      };
      // Add the circle object to the array
      circles.push(circle);
    }
  }
}

function windowResized() {
  resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
```

*In this code, the createCircles() function is called in the setup() function and in the keyPressed() function. This function creates the circles with a predictable sequence of pseudo-random numbers, thanks to the randomSeed() function. When a key is pressed, a new seed is generated and the circles are recreated with a new sequence of pseudo-random numbers.*

ðŸ¤“ :  **Can you tell me a bit more about this randomSeed and how it works ? is it the same as the seed use in generative AI for image generation ? like midjourney ?**

ðŸ¤– : *Yes, the concept of a seed in random number generation is quite similar across different applications, be it in p5.js for visual animations or in generative AI for image generation.*

*In random number generation, a seed is a starting point for the sequence of random numbers. If you do not explicitly set a seed, a random one is chosen based on some unpredictable parameter, like the current time in milliseconds. If you provide a seed, the random number generator will produce a sequence of numbers that appear random, but that sequence will be the same each time you start with the same seed geeksforgeeks.org.*

*In p5.js, the randomSeed() function is used to seed the random number generator. It affects the sequence of random numbers produced by the random() function. If you call randomSeed() with the same value, you'll get the same sequence of numbers from random() every time geeksforgeeks.org.*

*In the context of generative AI for image generation, a seed can be used to generate the same output every time the model is run with the same seed. This can be useful for debugging or for creating variations of a particular output by slightly modifying the seed.*

*In both cases, the seed is a way to get a predictable sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which can be useful for creating reproducible results or animations. If you want different results each time your code runs, you can either not set a seed, or set a seed based on some unpredictable parameter, like the current time happycoding.io.*
