Ouch ! we have only 1h30 for the workshop.

Let's prompt again :
Thank you but the workshop is only 1h30 long and it should focus on interacting with a LLM and coding. The approach is to learn by doing. At the end : participants should have tools and examples to get started in creative coding. Can you review your plan to have a more direct approach ?

**Workshop Outline (1.5 hours):**

**Introduction to LLMs (15 minutes):**
- Briefly introduce LLMs and their relevance to creative coding.
- Mention that participants will learn by doing during the workshop.

**Hands-On Coding Session (60 minutes):**
- Use Python and the OpenAI GPT-3 API for interactive coding.
- Provide a series of coding exercises:
  - Generate a piece of text-based art using GPT-3.
  - Create a code snippet for a specific programming task.
  - Generate creative writing or poetry.
  - Translate text between languages.
  - Brainstorm ideas for a design project.
- In each exercise, guide participants through using the API and coding interactively.
- Encourage participants to experiment and get creative with their code.

**Sharing and Q&A (15 minutes):**
- Allow participants to share their coding creations.
- Answer any questions or challenges they encountered.
- Provide quick tips and best practices.

**Resources and Next Steps (15 minutes):**
- Share resources for further learning:
  - OpenAI GPT-3 API Documentation.
  - GitHub repositories with code examples.
  - Online communities or forums for creative coding with LLMs.
- Suggest next steps and projects for participants to explore on their own.

**Conclusion (15 minutes):**
- Recap the key takeaways from the workshop.
- Encourage participants to continue experimenting with LLMs in their creative coding projects.
- Thank the participants for their participation.

This streamlined approach focuses on hands-on coding exercises and immediate interaction with the LLM, allowing participants to gain practical experience and tools for creative coding within the 1.5-hour timeframe.

Great question! If I were teaching a workshop on leveraging large language models (LLM) to assist in creative coding tasks, here’s what I might cover:

1. Introduction to Large Language Models: Start off by giving attendees a basic understanding of how LLM works and its potential applications within the context of programming. This could include information on various models like GPT-3 or BERT, as well as their underlying architecture, training methodologies, etc.

2. Use cases & real world scenarios: Illustrate some real life scenarios where LLM has been used successfully in programmatic endeavors such as code generation/completion, commenting/documentation enhancement, debugging support, testing automation etcetera. Share insights from industry leaders who have already experimented with this approach when solving complex problems through AI-assisted code writing solutions - highlight success stories that demonstrate the positive impact they've made across diverse domains including web development, game design, data science projects et cetera.

3. Hands On Examples & Demonstrations : Set up interactive demos showcasing different use cases involving generation/completion toolkits like Textualizer , Dash, Copilot, CoderAI etcetera ; thus enabling participants gain firsthand experience in leveraging these advanced technological offerings while keeping costs low compared against building similar infrastructure internally . Allow them to get acquainted with popular frameworks like Grammarly Editor which employs machine learning algorithms for improving syntax and style improvements during content creation phase https://editor.grammarly.com/editor/. Additionally share valuable resources like open source libraries (like TensorFlow ) available at their disposal should anyone decide pursuing further research into cutting edge areas concerning natural language processing / machine learning based solutions geared toward advancing programming
